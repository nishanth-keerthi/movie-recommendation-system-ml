This is a Collaborative filtering ML Project I learnt in a Workshop.I have used the MovieLens 100k Dataset.
In that dataset I have used u.data and u.item files.
I have used correlation factor to predict similar movies based on user ratings and similarities.
The main code is present in the .ipynb file with comments as to what each line of code does.
